## General writeup
I have used (0-1)knapsack technique to solve this problem  
Although this method is expensive due to array intialisation  
If best possible combination wasn't a issue we could have sorted the (MempoolTransaction)objects in decresing order and added to   
the block.  


## Note
```
If you are getting memory error this might be due to processor speed
reduse capacity or number of items 
or
f.readlines()[0:500]
```
